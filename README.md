# OrbitalMechanicsFinalProj2019

-This is a Matlab Project I created at San Luis Obispo during my 3rd year there in 2019 for a final Orbital Mechanics Project.
-The assignment was to plan out a space debris clean-up mission where our spacecraft will go to a piece of real space debris, do 5 orbits with the debris, and then go to another debris and repeat.
-My project follows space debris from two LEO orbits, one MEO, and one GEO. The project showcases a variety of transfer methods including simply INC and Phase changes, hohmann transfer, and lamberts transfer
-In addition to calculating the delta-V required at each transfer, I also provided an animation of the whole mission. Enjoy
